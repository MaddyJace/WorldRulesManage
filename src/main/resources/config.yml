# Event Listeners Master Switch
# Minecraft events occur constantly; each event executes plugin code.
# If you only want to use some features (e.g., blockBreak and blockPlace), enabling unused features consumes extra performance.
#
# You can selectively enable/disable listeners based on your needs.
# Some events, if disabled, will globally disable their features regardless of settings in globalRules/radiusRules.
#
# If unsure, keep defaults.
